# Definition of Done

Code is considered done only when all of the following are true:

- Formatting passes (Pint / Prettier or equivalent).
- Static analysis and type checks pass.
- Tests pass (backend and frontend where applicable).
- CI passes using the same commands run locally.
- No TODOs, debug statements, dumps, or console logs.
- No commented-out or dead code.
- No unused imports, variables, or files.
- Code is readable, boring, and maintainable.
- Changes are scoped only to what was intended.

If any item above is not met, the work is not done.
